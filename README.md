## Integration Project

STATUS: It is not finished because I didn't have time. However, I would love to explain what was the idea.

The idea behind this project was to create an structure easy to integrate with external APIs. This is a common problem for big projects.
I have created a similar structure like this for bigger projects I worked.

Advantages: 
1. It is easy to integrate with loads of different kinds of APIs/Webservices.
2. Easy to maintain.
3. Easy to write unit tests.
...

I would talk more about this if you want. :D
